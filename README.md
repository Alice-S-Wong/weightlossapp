# weightlossapp

I ran into some trouble while creating the app for the project. I was unable to figure out how to correctly use a nested serializer to display user information for questions and answers (users being a foreign key for both questions and answers). This issue has prevented me from moving forward with the project, as using post requests to create new questions and answers requires the ability to input the user foreign key, which I was unable to implement. This led to a similar problem with the bookmarks, which I split into bookmarked questions and bookmarked answers. These also rely on a user foreign key to tie them to a specific user so that user only sees their bookmarks. 

Django is one of my weaker frameworks and as such I am not as confident or capable with it. If I were to remake the project in Ruby and the framework Rails, I'm certain I could complete the project. I would be willing to work on that if that is an acceptable alternative.
